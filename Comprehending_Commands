#Comprehending Commands

##cat: not the pet, but the command

I understood that the cat command reads the terminal input.

i used cat flag to get the flag

##catting absolute paths

I used the absolue path of flag and found the flag by running this command: cat /flag

##more catting practice

found the flag using the absolute path and without cding into the file directory

##grep for a needle in a haystack
