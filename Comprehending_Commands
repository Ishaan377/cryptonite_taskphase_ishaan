#Comprehending Commands

##cat: not the pet, but the command

I understood that the cat command reads the terminal input.

i used cat flag to get the flag

##catting absolute paths

I used the absolue path of flag and found the flag by running this command: cat /flag

##more catting practice

found the flag using the absolute path and without cding into the file directory

##grepping for a needle in a haystack

here i lernt about the grep command that helps in searching for a certain string, given

as an argument, in a file. After grepping for the string pwn.college i found the flag.

##listing files

In this lesson, i came across the listing files(ls) command. This command, when run,

provides the list of files in the current directory. After using ls command in the 

/challenge directory, i found the file containing flag

##touching files

I was told to create two files(/tmp/pwn and /tmp/college) to be able to run the

/challenge/run file to get the flag. This was done by using the touch command which is used to create files.
syntax: touch <file_name>\

##removing files

Just like touch, a command to create files, there exists a command to remove files, namely, rm

Syntax: rm <file_name>
Only after removing the file delete_me was i able to run the file /challenge/check to get the flag
