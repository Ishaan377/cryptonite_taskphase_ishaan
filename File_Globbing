#File Globbing

##Matching with *
I learnt about the glob character *
When a directory/file name is executes with * , it gets replaced
with the matching name. In this challenge, I had to
cd into /challenge withput specifiing more than 4 characters
Commands:
cd /ch*
/challenge/run

##Matching with ?
Similiar to the previous one but isntead of replacing
multiple matching characters in case of *, ? just gets
replaced by one character.
Commands:
cd /?ha??enge
/challenge/run

##Matching with []
Similiar to the previous one, except, unlike ?,
[] replaces the place with a single matching character, it chooses
matching characters from a given set.
Command:
cd /challenge/files
/challenge/run file_[bash]
Here the file names were file_b, file_a, file_s, file_h.
